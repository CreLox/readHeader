This MATLAB function can read/process the header of a formatted (binary) file. Field(property) explanation files and associated utility scripts are stored in the FormatDocs folder. I would like to thank Dr. J. Damon Hoff (from the SMART Center at the Univerisity of Michigan, Ann Arbor) for his ground-laying contributions.
